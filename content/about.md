Hi, I am **Oleksandr Semeniuta**, a researcher with a passion for practical application of computational solutions based on open source technologies. Currently, I hold a position of Associate Professor at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/) (NTNU) in Gj√∏vik, Norway. The areas I deal with the most are data science for manufacturing applications, computer vision, industrial robotics (particularly the aspects of system integration, vision-based robotics, and distributed computing for robotic applications), and 3D printing (algorithmic solutions for quality assurance).

You are welcome to visit the following resources to learn more about my work:
