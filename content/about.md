I am **Oleksandr Semeniuta**, a software engineer and researcher. Currently at Cisco, working on [intelligent camera features of Cisco video collaboration devices](https://www.webex.com/us/en/solutions/camera-intelligence-cisco-devices.html). Earlier, contributed to research activities towards [digitalization of manufacturing in Norway](https://ncemanufacturing.no), with a focus on applying computer vision and data driven solutions to manufacturing automation. I hold a PhD degree in [Signals and Systems from Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/e2/research/systems-and-control), and enjoy crafting software requiring autonomous systems thinking, e.g. for systems with sensor-based, networked and event-driven aspects.

In this blog I am primarily sharing practical know-how to related to programming, data science, and managing Linux/Unix systems.
