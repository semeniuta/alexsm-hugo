Hi, I am **Oleksandr Semeniuta**, a software engineer at [Cisco Collaboration](https://www.cisco.com/) in Lysaker, Norway, contributing to R&D efforts that bring about the amazing [Cisco Webex Devices](https://www.webex.com/video-conference-equipment.html). I came to Cisco from academic/research background (NTNU, SINTEF Manufacturing), where I was applying computational solutions to manufacturing problems.  The areas I dealt with included data science for manufacturing applications, computer vision, industrial robotics (particularly the aspects of system integration, vision-based robotics, and distributed computing for robotic applications), and 3D printing (algorithmic solutions for quality assurance).

I enjoy working with open source technologies and share useful know-how I learn while hacking around. This blog is the place for that. 

You are welcome to visit the following resources with some of the work I have done:
